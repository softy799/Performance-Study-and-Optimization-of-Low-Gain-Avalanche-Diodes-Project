# Performance Study and Optimization of Low Gain Avalanche Diodes -- Research Assistant Project 
This repository contains a compilation of all the different code from the project I was a part of at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the physics department. 
I worked visualizing and predicting temperature-resistance relationships using Machine Learning Libraries in Python. **Matplotlib** was used for visualizing the raw data (resistance vs temprature) and the fit curve produded by optimzied parameters. **Scipy** was used for numerical computations of e^x and the natual logarithms, convertig lists to **NumPY** arrays, and filtering the data within a specified range of temperatures. **NumPY** was used for fitting the resistance_equation model to experimental data (Kelvin vs. Resistance) by optimizing the parameters.
